This is suppose to be for more or less finalized code related to clustering and plotting plumes and chords for the ASR project Size Decompositions of Observed and Simulated Shallow Convective Cloud Fields
The general development is done in jupyter notebooks, but all the important functions should be moved here when done.

Thanks to https://github.com/deehzee/unionfind for the unionfind code which is used to detect which cells are connected in 2D and 3D. I hope I used his code correctly by including the MIT license and copyright to the unionfind file.
